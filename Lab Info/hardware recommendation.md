-----------------------------

This is just a recommendation list. 

We have enough Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB RAM) in lab for you to use.

This winter, I bought such set-up to build my own Raspberry Pi system. It costs nearly $ 300.

If you want to play with Raspberry Pi at your dorm, you may try similar settings.
